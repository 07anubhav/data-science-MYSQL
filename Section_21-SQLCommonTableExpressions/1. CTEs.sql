/*
In SQL, every query-and sometimes part of a query or subquery-produces a result or a temporary dataset
- CTE	: Common Table Expression is a tool for obtaining such temporary result sets that exist within the execution of a given query
In other words, the temporary results that cannot be referred to in a  query other than the once they've been created in.
- We can use CTE in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
- CTE is also known as named subqueries
- A CTE can be referred multiple times within a query
- We can refer to a CTE defined earlier within a given WITH clause. We cannot refer to one that has been defined after
